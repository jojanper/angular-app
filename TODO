Some thoughts for further development:
--------------------------------------

- Options to alert messages
- Alert messages are removed on sign-out
- Inherit AlertService from more abstract base class?
- Drag+drop demo
- Network service
- Generic form component
  - Formalize model (new methods: addInput(), etc)
  - Initial values for form input
- Generic table component using DT
- User register component
- Header links in main page as own component
