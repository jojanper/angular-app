Some thoughts for further development:
--------------------------------------

- Options to alert messages
- Alert messages are removed on sign-out
- Rename shared folder as services
- Further split components within widgets folder
  Such as:
   - alert
   - datatables
- Inherit AlertService from more abstract base class?
- Possibility to manually close alert messages
- Drag+drop demo
- Network service
- Generic form component
- Generic table component using DT
