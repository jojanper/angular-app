Some thoughts for further development:
--------------------------------------

- Options to alert messages
- Inherit AlertService from more abstract base class?
- Drag+drop demo
- Network service
- Generic form component
  - Read only and edit modes, save returns form back to read mode
- Generic table component using DT
  - Static vs dynamic creation
  - Contruct columns from child components?
- User register component
- Include also E2E tests to Travis CI
