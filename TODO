Some thoughts for further development:
--------------------------------------

- Options to alert messages
- Drag+drop demo
- Network service
- Generic form component
  - Read only and edit modes, save returns form back to read mode
  - Add select and checkbox input tests
- Generic table component using DT
  - Server side rendering
  - Row details?
- User register component
- Audio player with custom controls
  - flowplayer as basis?
  - Volume knob
