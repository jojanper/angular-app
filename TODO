- User register component
  - Register
  - Reset password
  - Forgot password
- Frontend route resolver
  - e.g., resolve 'login' -> '/auth/login'
- Options to alert messages
- Drag+drop demo
- Generic form component
  - Read only and edit modes, save returns form back to read mode
  - Add select and checkbox input tests
- Generic table component using DT
  - Server side rendering
  - Row details?
- Audio player with custom controls
  - flowplayer as basis?
  - Volume knob
- App versioning
  - Indicate availability of new application update to user
