Some thoughts for further development:
--------------------------------------

- Component form can be created directly from API data (login, register, etc)
- User register component
  - Register
  - Reset password
  - Forgot password
- Split routes to home+rest of views?
- Options to alert messages
- Drag+drop demo
- Dialog component
- Generic form component
  - Read only and edit modes, save returns form back to read mode
  - Add select and checkbox input tests
- Generic table component using DT
  - Server side rendering
  - Row details?
- Audio player with custom controls
  - flowplayer as basis?
  - Volume knob
- App versioning
  - Indicate availability of new application update to user
- AppVeyor support (https://www.appveyor.com/)?
- Switch to use angular-cli as direct build tool instead of handwritten webpack?
- Study: Angular5 + Firebase
  - https://firebase.google.com/
  - https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/building-an-angular-5-project-with-bootstrap-4-and-firebase-4504ff7717c1
- Spinner action/observable?
  - Hooked to form (to make it non-editable while HTTP request is under progress)
- Mock authentication for dev server?
